# Nexara Protocol — Audit & Upgrade Policy

**Maintained by**: Sovereign Architect (MJ Ahmad)  
**Purpose**: To define the security, audit, and upgrade principles of Nexara Protocol

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Security is not just technical—it is **ethical accountability**.  
Upgrades are not just improvements—they are **collective commitments**.

---

## 🔐 Audit Principles

1. **Transparency First**  
   All contracts must be publicly auditable and verified on-chain.

2. **Independent Review**  
   All core modules (Gov, Treasury, Merit) must undergo third-party audits before activation.

3. **Community Oversight**  
   Audit reports must be published and open for community review and challenge.

4. **Zero-Day Disclosure**  
   Any critical vulnerability must be reported privately to the Sovereign Architect or designated maintainers.
