   All logic, decisions, and flows must be open, auditable, and traceable.

3. **Merit Over Majority**  
   Influence is earned through contribution and alignment, not popularity or wealth.

   Code must serve humanity, not replace its conscience.

5. **Sovereignty of Purpose**  
   Nexara shall never be co-opted by centralized interests or corrupted by short-term gain.
