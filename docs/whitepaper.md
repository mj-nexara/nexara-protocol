## 🧭 Abstract

Nexara is a protocol for ethical governance, financial sovereignty, and incorruptible automation. It is built on the belief that dignity, transparency, and merit must be embedded in the very logic of systems—not just in their intentions.

## 🧬 1. Philosophy

- **Dignity First**: Every participant is a sovereign entity.
- **Transparency by Design**: All logic is auditable and open.
- **Merit Over Majority**: Influence is earned, not bought.
- **Automation with Ethics**: Code must serve conscience.
