**Author**: Sovereign Architect (MJ Ahmad)  
**Genesis Date**: July 3, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0

## 🧬 Abstract

Nexara is a protocol for ethical governance, financial sovereignty, and incorruptible automation. It reimagines decentralized systems not as tools of speculation, but as instruments of dignity, transparency, and collective empowerment.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

- **Dignity First**: Every participant is respected, regardless of role or merit.
- **Merit Over Majority**: Influence is earned through contribution, not capital.
- **Transparency by Design**: All logic and flows are open, auditable, and purpose-bound.
- **Automation with Ethics**: Code must serve conscience, not override it.
