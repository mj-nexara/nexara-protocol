# NexaraGov — Emergency Protocol

**Maintained by**: Sovereign Architect (MJ Ahmad)  
**Purpose**: To define the ethical and procedural boundaries for emergency actions within Nexara Protocol

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Emergencies—whether technical, economic, or existential—require swift action.  
But in Nexara, **urgency must never override ethics**.

---

## 🚨 What Qualifies as an Emergency?

| Category         | Examples |
|------------------|----------|
| 🛡️ Security Threat | Critical smart contract vulnerability, exploit in progress |
| 🪙 Economic Risk   | Treasury drain, token manipulation, liquidity collapse |
| 🏛️ Governance Failure | Vote manipulation, role hijacking, protocol deadlock |
| 🧬 Existential Breach | Violation of Constitution, loss of sovereignty |

---

## 🟣 Sovereign Architect Authority

- May override governance temporarily
- May pause or disable contracts (if designed)
- May issue emergency proposals or veto malicious ones

---

## 🔐 Constraints on Emergency Power

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🕒 Time-Bound | Emergency powers expire after 7 days unless ratified by governance |
| 📜 Justification Required | All actions must be documented and published |
| 🧾 On-Chain Logging | All overrides must emit events and be traceable |
| 🧠 Post-Facto Review | Community may challenge or reverse actions via proposal |
