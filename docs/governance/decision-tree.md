# NexaraGov — Governance Decision Tree

**Maintained by**: Sovereign Architect (MJ Ahmad)  
**Purpose**: To define the lifecycle of a proposal from submission to execution within NexaraGov

---

## 🧬 Overview

Governance in Nexara is not a vote of popularity—it is a **merit-weighted, role-aware, ethically aligned process**.
