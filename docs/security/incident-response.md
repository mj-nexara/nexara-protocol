# Nexara Protocol — Incident Response Protocol

**Maintained by**: Sovereign Architect (MJ Ahmad)  
**Purpose**: To define how Nexara responds to security breaches, ethical violations, and critical failures

---

## 🧠 Response Philosophy

In Nexara, response is not just reaction—it is **responsibility in motion**.  
Every incident is an opportunity to reinforce trust, not erode it.

---

## 🚨 What Qualifies as an Incident?

| Type              | Examples |
|-------------------|----------|
| 🛡️ Security Breach | Smart contract exploit, unauthorized access |
| 🧾 Governance Abuse | Vote manipulation, role hijacking |
| 💰 Treasury Misuse | Unauthorized fund release, purpose spoofing |
| 🧬 Ethical Violation | Harassment, coercion, persona breach |
| 🧠 Merit Fraud     | Collusion, circular boosting, false attribution |
