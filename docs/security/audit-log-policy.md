# Nexara Protocol — Audit Log Policy

**Maintained by**: Sovereign Architect (MJ Ahmad)  
**Purpose**: To define how all critical actions, decisions, and changes are logged, stored, and reviewed within Nexara

---

## 🧠 Logging Philosophy

In Nexara, memory is not optional—it is **ethical infrastructure**.  
Every action must leave a trace, and every trace must be verifiable.

---

## 🧾 What Must Be Logged?

| Category         | Examples |
|------------------|----------|
| Governance       | Proposal creation, voting, execution |
| Treasury         | Fund disbursement, purpose approval |
| Roles            | Assignment, revocation, escalation |
| Upgrades         | Contract changes, versioning |
| Emergencies      | Overrides, justifications, ratifications |
| Merit Adjustments| Manual changes, recalibrations |

---

## 🔐 On-Chain Logging

- All smart contracts must emit events for:
  - `ProposalCreated`, `VoteCast`, `ProposalExecuted`
  - `FundsReleased`, `PurposeApproved`
  - `RoleAssigned`, `RoleRevoked`
  - `MeritAdjusted`, `EmergencyOverride`

- Events must include:
  - `msg.sender`
  - Timestamp
  - Reason or metadata hash (if applicable)

---

## 🗃️ Off-Chain Logging

- Markdown-based logs stored in:
  - `docs/governance/ratified-actions.md`
  - `docs/treasury/disbursement-log.md`
  - `docs/security/threat-model.md`
  - `docs/security/audit-log-policy.md` (this file)

- Optional IPFS hash for external audit reports

---

## 🧪 Review & Retention

- Logs are reviewed quarterly by Guardians
- Immutable logs are retained indefinitely
- Mutable logs (e.g., merit adjustments) must include version history

---

## 🧬 Audit Trail Integrity

- All logs must be:
  - Human-readable
  - Machine-indexable
  - Ethically contextualized
