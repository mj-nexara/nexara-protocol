## 🧭 Why This Page Exists

Nexara is not just a protocol—it is a promise.  
A promise that dignity can be encoded, that governance can be ethical, and that sovereignty can be shared.

But behind every protocol is a person.  
And behind Nexara stands one individual—working with limited resources, physical challenges, and unwavering conviction.
