# Nexara Protocol — Ethics Manifesto

**Maintained by**: Sovereign Architect (MJ Ahmad)  
**Purpose**: To define the ethical boundaries, values, and decision-making principles of Nexara

---

## 🧬 Foundational Ethics

1. **Dignity is Absolute**  
   Every participant, regardless of role or merit, is to be treated with respect.

2. **Transparency is Non-Negotiable**  
   All logic, decisions, and flows must be open, auditable, and traceable.

3. **Merit is Earned, Not Assumed**  
   Influence must be based on contribution and alignment—not wealth or popularity.

4. **Power Must Be Accountable**  
   All roles, including the Sovereign Architect, are bound by purpose—not privilege.

5. **Code Must Serve Conscience**  
   Automation must never override ethical judgment.

This manifesto is not a restriction—it is a **reminder**.  
That power without ethics is tyranny.  
That automation without conscience is chaos.  
That sovereignty without dignity is meaningless.
