# Nexara Governance Decision Tree

## 🧭 Purpose

This document outlines the structured flow of decision-making within the Nexara Protocol. It ensures that all proposals, upgrades, and disputes are resolved through a transparent, merit-weighted, and ethically aligned process.

---

## 🪜 Decision Flow Overview

```
Proposal → Evaluation → Merit Weighting → Voting → Execution
```

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Proposal Submission

- Any contributor may submit a proposal (technical, financial, governance)
- Must include:
  - Objective
  - Rationale
  - Ethical alignment statement
  - Impact analysis

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Evaluation

- Core maintainers review for:
  - Technical feasibility
  - Ethical alignment
  - Redundancy or conflict with existing logic

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Merit Weighting

- Votes are weighted based on:
  - Role (e.g., Architect, Maintainer, Contributor)
  - Historical contributions
  - Reputation score (future DAO integration)

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Voting

- Transparent voting via smart contract or off-chain snapshot
- Minimum quorum and majority thresholds apply
- Emergency override possible by Sovereign Architect (only in existential threats)

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Execution

- Approved proposals are merged, deployed, or scheduled
- All changes are logged and auditable

---

## 🛡️ Dispute Resolution

- Disputes are escalated to a **Council of Merit** (trusted contributors)
- Final arbitration rests with the Sovereign Architect, bound by the Nexara Constitution

---

## 🧬 Governance Philosophy

- **No plutocracy**: Wealth ≠ power
- **No mob rule**: Popularity ≠ truth
- **Meritocracy with ethics**: Contribution + alignment = influence
